Step 1: Calculate the concentration of Silicon atoms (N)
N = (Density * Avogadro's Number) / Atomic Weight
N = (2.33 * 10^6 g/m^3 * 6.02 * 10^23 atoms/g-atom) / 28.1
N = 4.99 * 10^28 atoms/m^3

Step 2: Calculate the relative concentration
Relative concentration = (Concentration of Si atoms) / (Intrinsic carrier density)
Relative concentration = N / n_i
Relative concentration = (4.99 * 10^28) / (1.5 * 10^16)
Relative concentration = 3.33 * 10^12
(This means there is 1 electron-hole pair for every 3.33 * 10^12 silicon atoms)

Step 3: Calculate Intrinsic Conductivity (σ_i)
The charge of an electron (e) is 1.6 * 10^-19 C.
σ_i = n_i * e * (μ_e + μ_h)
σ_i = (1.5 * 10^16) * (1.6 * 10^-19) * (0.14 + 0.05)
σ_i = (2.4 * 10^-3) * (0.19)
σ_i = 4.56 * 10^-4 S/m (or Ω^-1·m^-1)

Step 4: Calculate Intrinsic Resistivity (ρ_i)
Resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity.
ρ_i = 1 / σ_i
ρ_i = 1 / (4.56 * 10^-4)
ρ_i = 2192.98 Ω-m
