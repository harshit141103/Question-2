Example 51.8: Compute the relative concentration of donor atoms and electron-hole pairs at 300K.
Also, calculate intrinsic resistivity of silicon.

Given:
- Avogadro's number = 6.02 × 10²³ atoms/g-atom
- Density = 2.33 × 10³ g/m³
- Atomic Weight = 28.1
- Intrinsic carrier density (nᵢ) = 1.5 × 10¹⁶ m⁻³
- μₑ = 0.14 m²/V·s
- μₕ = 0.05 m²/V·s

Step 1: Calculate the number of silicon atoms per unit volume (N)
N = (Density × Avogadro's number) / Atomic Weight
N = (2.33 × 10³ × 6.02 × 10²³) / 28.1
N = 14.0266 × 10²⁶ / 28.1
N = 4.99 × 10²⁸ atoms/m³

Step 2: Calculate the relative concentration of donor atoms to electron-hole pairs
Given intrinsic carrier density nᵢ = 1.5 × 10¹⁶ m⁻³

Ratio = N / nᵢ
Ratio = (4.99 × 10²⁸) / (1.5 × 10¹⁶)
Ratio = 3.33 × 10¹²

This means there is 1 electron-hole pair for every 3.33 × 10¹² silicon atoms.

Step 3: Calculate the intrinsic resistivity (ρᵢ)
The conductivity of intrinsic silicon is:
σᵢ = nᵢ × e × (μₑ + μₕ)

where e = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C (charge of electron)

σᵢ = 1.5 × 10¹⁶ × 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ × (0.14 + 0.05)
σᵢ = 1.5 × 10¹⁶ × 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ × 0.19
σᵢ = 4.56 × 10⁻⁴ S/m

Resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity:
ρᵢ = 1 / σᵢ
ρᵢ = 1 / (4.56 × 10⁻⁴)
ρᵢ = 2193 Ω·m
ρᵢ ≈ 2.19 × 10³ Ω·m

Final Answers:
1. Relative concentration: 1 electron-hole pair per 3.33 × 10¹² silicon atoms
2. Intrinsic resistivity of silicon: ρᵢ = 2.19 × 10³ Ω·m (or 2193 Ω·m)
